        I am final year student at Brawijaya University, class of 2021. Along
        with seeking experience in various fields, activities and organization,
        I also explore technologies used in web development, such as front end
        and back end ( cause i want to be full stack at my end web dev journey
        ). Although I am focused on the web, I am also interested in other
        fields such as AI, network, and devops.
